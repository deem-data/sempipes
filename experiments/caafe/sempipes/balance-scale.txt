{'generated_code': ['', '# left_right_moment_difference (Difference between left and right moments)\n# Usefulness: This feature directly calculates the difference between the "left moment" (left-weight * left-distance) and the "right moment" (right-weight * right-distance). According to the dataset description, the class is determined by which side has a greater moment, or if they are equal. A positive difference indicates a left tip, a negative difference indicates a right tip, and a zero difference indicates balance. This provides highly discriminative information for the RandomForestClassifier.\n# Input samples: \'left-weight\': [np.float64(5.0), np.float64(5.0), np.float64(1.0)], \'left-distance\': [np.float64(4.0), np.float64(4.0), np.float64(3.0)], \'right-weight\': [np.float64(3.0), np.float64(4.0), np.float64(4.0)], \'right-distance\': [np.float64(4.0), np.float64(3.0), np.float64(2.0)]\ndf[\'left_right_moment_difference\'] = (df[\'left-weight\'] * df[\'left-distance\']) - (df[\'right-weight\'] * df[\'right-distance\'])', '# abs_moment_difference (Absolute magnitude of the difference between left and right moments)\n# Usefulness: This feature captures the absolute magnitude of the imbalance, indicating how "strongly" the scale tips to one side or how "close" it is to being balanced. While the sign of the moment difference determines the class, the absolute value can provide the RandomForestClassifier with additional information about the confidence or strength of that imbalance. This can help refine decision boundaries and improve probability estimates, potentially leading to a slight boost in roc_auc_ovo, even when the primary classification rule is already well-captured.\n# Input samples: \'left_right_moment_difference\': [np.float64(8.0), np.float64(8.0), np.float64(-5.0)]\ndf[\'abs_moment_difference\'] = abs(df[\'left_right_moment_difference\'])']}

{'generated_code': ['', "import numpy as np\n# moment_difference (Difference between left and right moments)\n# Usefulness: This feature directly encodes the core logic for determining the balance scale's class. The sign of this difference (positive, negative, or zero) directly corresponds to whether the scale tips left, right, or remains balanced. A Random Forest classifier can efficiently use this single numerical feature to make splits that perfectly separate the classes, as it encapsulates the comparison of left and right torques.\n# Input samples: 'left-weight': [np.float64(5.0), np.float64(4.0), np.float64(5.0)], 'left-distance': [np.float64(5.0), np.float64(5.0), np.float64(3.0)], 'right-weight': [np.float64(5.0), np.float64(4.0), np.float64(2.0)], 'right-distance': [np.float64(3.0), np.float64(1.0), np.float64(5.0)]\ndf['moment_difference'] = (df['left-weight'] * df['left-distance']) - (df['right-weight'] * df['right-distance'])"]}

It provides a pre-computed interaction term that is highly relevant for the classification task, mirroring the \'left_moment\' feature.\n# Input samples: \'right-weight\': [3.0, 1.0, 3.0], \'right-distance\': [4.0, 3.0, 4.0]\ndf[\'right_moment\'] = df[\'right-weight\'] * df[\'right-distance\']', "# moment_difference (Difference between left moment and right moment)\n# Usefulness: This feature directly calculates the net moment on the balance scale. According to the problem description, the class is determined by comparing the left and right moments. A positive difference indicates the scale tips left, a negative difference indicates it tips right, and a zero difference indicates it is balanced. This single feature encapsulates the primary decision logic, making it highly informative for the classifier.\n# Input samples: 'left_moment': [25.0, 25.0, 20.0], 'right_moment': [12.0, 3.0, 12.0]\ndf['moment_difference'] = df['left_moment'] - df['right_moment']", "# absolute_moment_difference (Absolute difference between left and right moments)\n# Usefulness: This feature quantifies the magnitude of the imbalance, irrespective of the direction. While `moment_difference` indicates which way the scale tips, `absolute_moment_difference` provides information about *how much* it tips. This could help the classifier distinguish between cases that are slightly off-balance versus heavily off-balance, potentially aiding in finer distinctions or confidence levels, even if the primary classification is already well-captured by `moment_difference`.\n# Input samples: 'left_moment': [25.0, 25.0, 20.0], 'right_moment': [12.0, 3.0, 12.0], 'moment_difference': [13.0, 22.0, 8.0]\ndf['absolute_moment_difference'] = abs(df['moment_difference'])"]}

{'generated_code': ['', "# Moment Difference (Left - Right)\n# Usefulness: This feature directly calculates the net moment on the balance scale, which is the fundamental physical principle determining the class. A positive value indicates a tip to the left, a negative value indicates a tip to the right, and a zero value indicates balance. This directly encodes the classification logic described in the dataset, making it highly discriminative for a tree-based model like RandomForestClassifier.\n# Input samples: 'left-weight': [np.float64(3.0), np.float64(1.0), np.float64(2.0)], 'left-distance': [np.float64(5.0), np.float64(5.0), np.float64(1.0)], 'right-weight': [np.float64(2.0), np.float64(1.0), np.float64(4.0)], 'right-distance': [np.float64(1.0), np.float64(5.0), np.float64(1.0)]\ndf['moment_difference'] = (df['left-weight'] * df['left-distance']) - \\\n                          (df['right-weight'] * df['right-distance'])"]}
