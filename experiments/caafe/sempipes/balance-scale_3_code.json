According to the dataset description, the balance outcome is determined by comparing the products of weight and distance on both sides. This feature provides direct real-world semantic information crucial for classification.\n# Input samples: 'left-weight': [2.0, 3.0, 1.0], 'left-distance': [4.0, 5.0, 4.0]\ndf['left_lever_product'] = df['left-weight'] * df['left-distance']",

The balance class is directly derived from comparing this value with 'left_lever_product', making it semantically highly relevant for the classification task.\n# Input samples: 'right-weight': [3.0, 4.0, 5.0], 'right-distance': [2.0, 2.0, 5.0]\ndf['right_lever_product'] = df['right-weight'] * df['right-distance']",
        "# product_difference (Difference between left and right lever products)\n# Usefulness: This feature directly encodes the \"balance\" state of the scale according to the problem description. A positive value indicates the left side has more \"torque\", a negative value indicates the right side has more \"torque\", and zero indicates balance. This is the primary determinant of the target class 'y', making it a semantically optimal feature for a classifier aiming for high ROC AUC OVO.\n# Input samples: 'left_lever_product': [8.0, 15.0, 4.0], 'right_lever_product': [6.0, 8.0, 25.0]\ndf['product_difference'] = df['left_lever_product'] - df['right_lever_product']"
