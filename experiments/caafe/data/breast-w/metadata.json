    "description": "\n**Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set.** Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target feature records the prognosis (malignant or benign). [Original data available here](ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/cancer/)  \n\nCurrent dataset was adapted to ARFF format from the UCI version. Sample code ID's were removed.  \n\n! Note that there is also a related Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnosis) Data Set with a different set of features, better known as [wdbc](https://www.openml.org/d/1510).\n\n\n\n Citation request  \n\nThis breast cancer database was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.  If you publish results when using this database, then please include this information in your acknowledgments.  Also, please cite one or more of:\n\n   1. O. L. Mangasarian and W. H.
