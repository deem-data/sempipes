Short-haul flights might face different causes of delay (e.g., quick turnarounds, gate availability) compared to long-haul flights (e.g., air traffic control, crew rest requirements). Categorizing flight lengths can reveal these distinct delay patterns.\n# Input samples: 'Length': [np.float64(79.0), np.float64(65.0), np.float64(151.0), np.float64(68.0), np.float64(125.0)]\ndef get_length_category(length_minutes):\n    if length_minutes <= 60:\n        return 0 # Short\n    elif length_minutes <= 120:\n        return 1 # Medium\n    elif length_minutes <= 180:\n        return 2 # Long\n    else:\n        return 3 # Very Long\ndf['Length_Category'] = df['Length'].apply(get_length_category)",

Flights scheduled during these concentrated periods are more susceptible to delays due due to systemic congestion. This feature captures these critical, potentially delay-prone time windows.\n# Input samples: 'Time': [np.float64(372.0), np.float64(330.0), np.float64(535.0), np.float64(567.0), np.float64(1070.0)]\n# Morning Rush: 6:00 AM - 9:00 AM (360-540 minutes)\n# Evening Rush: 4:00 PM - 7:00 PM (960-1140 minutes)\ndf['IsPeakDepartureHour'] = ((df['Time'] >= 360) & (df['Time'] < 540)) | \\\n                            ((df['Time'] >= 960) & (df['Time'] < 1140))\ndf['IsPeakDepartureHour'] = df['IsPeakDepartureHour'].astype(int)"
