Leisure travel increases, business travel decreases, and airport/airline staffing might be adjusted. These differences can lead to distinct delay probabilities that the model can capture by explicitly knowing if the day is a weekend. Based on common convention where 0=Monday and 6=Sunday, we consider 5 (Saturday) and 6 (Sunday) as weekend days.\n# Input samples: 'DayOfWeek': [np.float64(1.0), np.float64(4.0), np.float64(0.0)]\ndf['IsWeekend'] = ((df['DayOfWeek'] == 5.0) | (df['DayOfWeek'] == 6.0)).astype(int)",
        "# PartOfDay (Categorical feature indicating the part of the day the flight is scheduled)\n# Usefulness: Flight delay patterns are highly dependent on the time of day. Early morning flights typically face fewer delays as congestion hasn't built up, while afternoon and evening flights are more susceptible due to cumulative delays, increased traffic, and potential weather changes. This categorical feature segments the 24-hour cycle into distinct periods (e.g., Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, Evening/Night), allowing the classifier to learn specific delay propensities for each period, which the continuous 'Time' column alone might not capture as explicitly.\n# Input samples: 'Time': [np.float64(1130.0), np.float64(760.0), np.float64(430.0)]\nimport numpy as np\nconditions = [\n    (df['Time'] <= 360),                 # 00:00 - 06:00 (Early Morning)\n    (df['Time'] > 360) & (df['Time'] <= 720), # 06:01 - 12:00 (Morning)\n    (df['Time'] > 720) & (df['Time'] <= 1080),# 12:01 - 18:00 (Afternoon)\n    (df['Time'] > 1080)                  # 18:01 - 24:00 (Evening/Night)\n]\nchoices = [0, 1, 2, 3]\ndf['PartOfDay'] = np.select(conditions, choices, default=-1) # Default should ideally not be hit with full range Time"
