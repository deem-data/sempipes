Immune Cell Atlas: This dataset contains 329,762 cells and includes 36,398 genes across twelve batches and three different
sequencing technologies (10x 5’ v1, 10x 5’ v2, 10x 3’ v3), collected by Conde et al.(2022). The cells originate from 16
different tissues. The annotations include 35 fine-grain cell types. 

We use 10x 5’ v2 technology as hold-out (query) data and 10x 5’ v1, 10x 3’ v3 as train (reference) data.
